            <h2>Space Exploration - Is It a Priority?</h2>
<p>
    &emsp; &emsp; If you were the leader of the country, would you try to explore space and spend your money on unnecessary technologies (at least right now), or would you help your country prosper as a whole? Would you save millions of people's lives, or would you enhance your technological capabilities? Would you solve your own country’s problems, or would you try to tackle problems in a whole different place? Currently, the world is falling apart. Raging wars, global crises, calamitous poverty, devastating hunger, and world-shaking climate change are all problems that are having an immense impact on our lives, and yet, we decide to spend $92,000,000,000 in 2021 itself on space exploration. This much money is enough to reduce the severity of any of these problems dramatically, but over tackling any and all of these problems, we chose to advance our technology in a very specific sector: space. I believe that it is not justified for governments and space organizations (private or owned by the government) to spend tens of billions of dollars on space exploration instead of spending it (or donating it - for private agencies) on problems faced by their own, respective countries, and the world altogether.

    &emsp; &emsp; Space exploration skyrocketed in the Cold War, when both Russia and the US competed to have better technologies, while 22 percent of the United States was in poverty. Back then, fighting a country just to get better technology was more important than trying to get your country out of poverty and prospering together. Space exploration soared because of an unnecessary competition between two nations, and now it continues to grow, regardless of the increasing problems taking place in the world. In 2020, NASA’s budget was $22,629,000,000, which is a 5.3% increase from 2019. This means that the year the entire US health department was collapsing, the US government itself was in debt, and when they were having riots that shook the fundamentals of the country, space exploration was getting funded over $22 billion. Doing this while knowing that, according to the USDA, 38 million people (including 12 million children), or 11.5% of the entire nation are food insecure in the USA, is like not doing their primary duty (keeping the country safe and healthy), which is unethical and immoral, according to the rights theory (Rights states that a society should be protected and should be given the highest priority by its leader) and deontology (Deontology is a theory that, among other important statements, states that a person should adhere to their duties, if in an ethical dilemma). According to The Borgen Project, it would require about $45,000,000,000 every year till 2030 to end world hunger, and in 2021 alone, space programs across the world were funded with over $90 billion, almost twice the cost required in a year.

    &emsp; &emsp; Other than having imbalanced priorities, rocket launches also cause enormous levels of pollution. Because they don’t happen extremely frequently, the greenhouse gas emissions by rockets are negligible currently, but environmentalists and scientists fear that with the newcoming ‘space tourism’, the emissions would increase by a lot. Also, these emissions usually take place in the stratosphere or above, a region of the atmosphere where we barely know anything, and although they could argue that that means it's not sure that it causes a lot of damage, we know the emissions are high and the damage caused to the atmosphere can be high or low, nobody knows for sure. This is a risk we shouldn’t be willing to take, as it can cause a lot of damage to our planet, by fueling climate change faster, eradicating species, melting the ice poles, and changing the looks and structure of our planet as a whole. Hence, I believe that we shouldn’t take this risk, as these emissions have a chance of causing more damage than the benefits.

    &emsp; &emsp; Lastly, space exploration leads to a lot of waste, and in the current world, that isn’t ideal. In this world, a place where people don’t have money to build houses for themselves, a place where wasting resources is killing the planet, a place where garbage is a huge factor to the biggest threat to our existence, we are wasting materials through space exploration. Space agencies waste tonnes of materials on every mission, and there is over 128,934,000 space debris (excluding 3000 dead satellites) of all sizes (from under 1 cm to over 10 cm) that threaten missions as well as countries on the Earth. This space debris, if it hits any spacecraft or military satellite, can threaten the security of an entire nation. If this space debris, moving at unimaginable speeds, hits any satellite, it can threaten the safety of a nation, can stop TV and all broadcasts, and can have immense large-scale implications. Hence, with all this space debris around our planet, and with so much waste getting generated by these agencies, space travel at large scales isn’t practical, moral, or responsible. Now, they might say that how do you know there won’t be space debris later, or are you saying we shouldn’t even explore space, the place we live in. The fact is that there are some missions to retract and clean up the surrounding space debris, and that itself will increase the safety of our planet and our missions immensely.

    &emsp; &emsp; The officials and people supporting space exploration say that it helps them build their technology, enable research (in the world’s most perplexing questions: for example, ‘How did life form?’, ‘Are we alone in the universe?’, ‘How did the universe form?’, or ‘Is there anything beyond the universe?’), and it feeds their curiosity. They claim this using Ethical Curiosity, which is your interest in an ethical dilemma, and yes, they aren’t wrong. Space exploration does have these advantages. Nevertheless, if we spend money and provide financial aid to the people in need and to solve the looming crises first, then we would be putting the money to better use, as we would be spending less on research and technology, and prioritizing solving the problems in our own backyard before our entire universe. Also, to make sure this happens, there should be regulations keeping the private space agencies in check, so that the consequences occurring by them have a smaller toll on our planet. Overall, although space exploration does have its own benefits, it can be held back for some time, till we minimize or even solve the disastrous threats faced by our planet.
